# Backlog

A collection point for deferred, future-work, and nice-to-have items scattered
across roost's specs and plans. This is not a commitment or a roadmap —
just everywhere "later" was said, gathered so it's findable. Pull items out
when they're actually picked up.

**Measured vs assumed.** Most entries arrived here as a spec's "nice-to-have"
with no stated reason, which means their *demand* was never established — only
that someone once imagined the feature. An entry that overstates its own demand
is worse than no entry, because it spends attention and nothing in the text
tells you which claims were checked. Entries carrying an **Evidence** line were
measured against this host on the date given; entries without one have not
been, and should be read as "someone wanted this once", not as a signal.

Some things are not measurable from here at all, and say so. That is a third
answer, not a quiet vote for "unused".

## First things to do:
- select file in tree or select text in preview, pres Cmd-<Key> and it gets pasted with @reference to Claude active terminal
- moving file/term tabs
- handle worktree selection/switching: top-bar left we already have project+branch, we should add worktree+selector. Rethink how to select/switch worktrees. In-place or new browser tab?
- fix popup UX+design (notifications, dialogs)
- settings system, 
- theme selector
- multi-wiew per project: now all windows synchronize to project. Could we have same project open with different tab layout / files open. So basically project could have different "views".

## UI / UX

- Git log view — nice-to-have in both the v2 and v3 specs; no stated reason,
  just unprioritized (`2026-08-16-deadlight-v2-design.md`,
  `2026-08-16-deadlight-v3-workspace-design.md`).
  **Evidence (2026-08-20): none either way.** `gitio.rs` has no log function, so
  nothing is half-built; Changes and Diff tabs already cover the "what did I
  just do" case a log view is usually reached for. Demand unmeasured.
- Mobile layout — nice-to-have in both the v2 and v3 specs, no stated reason
  (`2026-08-16-deadlight-v2-design.md`, `2026-08-16-deadlight-v3-workspace-design.md`).
  **Evidence (2026-08-20): unmeasurable, not unused.** roost never reads
  `User-Agent` anywhere in `src/`, and nothing logs it, so this host cannot say
  whether anyone has ever opened the workspace on a phone. Establishing demand
  would mean adding that logging first — which is itself a decision.
- Per-theme favicon — nice-to-have in both the v2 and v3 specs, no stated
  reason (`2026-08-16-deadlight-v2-design.md`,
  `2026-08-16-deadlight-v3-workspace-design.md`).
  **Evidence (2026-08-20): the feature it decorates is itself unused.** Five
  themes ship (`darcula`, `dark`, `gruvbox`, `light`, `solarized-dark`), but
  there are **0 user themes** in `~/.config/resh/static/themes/`, **0 project
  themes** in any `.resh/theme/`, and no `theme =` set in the global config —
  so every window is on the default. A favicon that varies by theme has nothing
  to vary with yet.
- Nothing prunes `state_dir()/pasted/`, where images pasted into a terminal
  are kept. Left open by the upload work
  (`2026-08-19-file-upload-design.md`).
  **Evidence (2026-08-20): the directory does not exist** in either the
  deployed or the dev state dir — nothing has ever been pasted on this host, so
  the worry has accumulated exactly nothing.
- Whether the 16-part cap on an upload request is the right number. Left open
  by the same work.
  **Evidence (2026-08-20): never approached.**
- **Redesign the transient message UI.** Upload errors and the upload progress
  indicator both borrow `showBanner`'s `.conflict` styling, which was designed
  for the save-conflict box and is wrong here: ugly, and positioned where a
  save conflict wants to be rather than where a transient notice does. Reported
  from real use, not from a test. The whole surface wants one design pass —
  errors, per-file upload results, and progress are three different things
  currently rendered as one, and progress in particular should probably sit in
  the pane it belongs to rather than floating over the layout
  (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-19-file-upload-design.md`).
  **Evidence: provenance, which is the strongest kind in this file.** This is
  the only UI/UX entry that came from someone hitting it in real use rather
  than from a spec's nice-to-have list. Nothing further to measure.
- ~~Heading anchors in markdown preview.~~ **Done (2026-08-31.)** Kept here
  because the entry described half the bug, and acting on it as written would
  have left every real anchor link in this repo still broken.
  It said `#section` links are inert for want of heading ids. Two separate
  things were wrong, and the *same-document* case it named was the unused one:
  this repo had **0** same-document `#anchor` links and **3** cross-document
  ones, all in `README.md`.
  1. **No heading carried an id.** `pulldown-cmark`'s `push_html` emits a bare
     `<h2>`. Measured before the fix: `docs/backlog.md` rendered 14 headings and
     0 `id=` attributes. `render::slug` now emits GitHub's slug, deliberately
     bug-compatible with `github-slugger` — it does not collapse runs, so
     "Files & folders" is `files--folders`, with two hyphens.
  2. **Cross-document fragments were discarded before the link was built.**
     `resolve_dest` splits `?`/`#` off to find the path on disk, and `link_open`
     then emitted only `data-rel` — so all five `docs/deploy.md#…` links in the
     README rendered byte-identically and opened the file at the top. The
     fragment now rides as `data-hash`, and `app.js`'s `revealAnchor` scrolls to
     it once the tab's fragment mounts.
  The link *element* was never the problem: `resolve_dest` has always returned
  `Passthrough` for a bare `#foo`, so a real `<a href="#foo">` was being
  emitted the whole time. Only the target was missing.
  Ids are bare rather than namespaced, so a link copied from GitHub works
  unchanged. The cost is accepted and worth not rediscovering: a preview is
  injected into the live workspace document, which owns ids like `#settings`
  and `#content`, so a heading with one of those names emits a duplicate.
  `tryAnchor` scopes its lookup to the preview's own `article` for that reason;
  a same-document jump is still the browser's own, and would land on the chrome.
  Measured 2026-08-31: no heading in any doc in this repo collides.

  **Real but unused here — do not prioritise it on the strength of the
  argument it was first filed with.** That argument was "a README's table of
  contents is the most common thing a markdown link points at, so this is the
  obvious next request", which reasoned from how markdown is used in general
  rather than from this corpus. Surveyed 2026-08-20: **0 of 137 markdown files
  under `/home/claude/projects` contain a single `](#anchor)` link**, and the
  only match anywhere in this repo is a test fixture inside the
  preview-links plan. Every link that does appear in these docs is
  file-to-file, and those work now.

  If it is ever picked up, three things need deciding, none obvious: slug
  generation must match GitHub's algorithm or links copied out of a
  GitHub-rendered doc will not resolve; generated ids must not collide with
  the workspace page's own (a heading called "Content" would collide with the
  pane's `#content`), since the preview is a fragment injected into a live
  page rather than a document of its own; and letting a fragment link change
  `location.hash` interacts with a single-page app whose URL already encodes
  the project.

- Source line ranges from a markdown preview selection, so Alt+K in a preview
  can send `@docs/deploy.md#L12-14` rather than the bare file. Deferred out of
  `2026-08-24-mention-routing-design.md`, which ships the preview trigger with
  no range.

  The approach is settled even though the work is not: pulldown-cmark 0.13
  (`Cargo.toml:26`) offers `into_offset_iter()`, which yields a byte range per
  event, so block-level source lines come from the parser rather than from
  hand-tracking. Two things make it more than a small change. It reshapes
  every arm of `markdown_html` — including `sanitize_raw_html` in
  `src/render.rs`, the pass that now handles raw HTML — and the link/image
  escaping surface, which CLAUDE.md's testing notes single out. And it is
  block-accurate only: a selection of three words
  inside a paragraph resolves to that paragraph's line span, not to the words,
  so the feature's ceiling is coarser than the editor's exact ranges.

  Worth recording alongside it, because it is not obvious from reading the
  code: `file_fragment`'s `<pre class="codeview">` branch — the one preview
  shape that *does* hold verbatim file text, and so the one that could give
  exact ranges for free — is unreachable from any Preview tab. `RENDERED_EXT`
  (`app.js:107`) is the only set that opens in Preview, and `routes.rs:415`
  routes every image extension in it to `image_fragment` before
  `file_fragment` is reached, leaving only markdown. Anyone picking this up
  and hoping to start with the easy case should know there isn't one.

- Notification centre on the picker page (`/`) as well as the workspace
  page — the notice store is already global, only the markup is missing
  (`2026-08-17-deadlight-notifications-design.md`).
  **Evidence (2026-08-20): the notification feature has never stored a notice.**
  `notifications.json` **does not exist** in `~/.local/state/resh/` or in the
  dev state dir. This applies to the next three entries as well — the picker
  centre, per-project mute and quiet hours, Web Push, and a relay sink are four
  entries resting on a feature with no recorded use on this host. Web Push in
  particular is the most expensive item in this file (VAPID signing, payload
  encryption, subscription storage); it should not be reached for until
  something is actually publishing notices worth chasing to a phone.
- Per-project notification mute and a quiet-hours window — deferred out of
  v1 alongside sound (`2026-08-17-deadlight-notifications-design.md`).
  **Evidence: see the notice-store finding above** — nothing to mute yet.
- Web Push for notifications. The service worker gains a `push` handler; the
  server gains VAPID signing, payload encryption, and subscription storage —
  the step that reaches a phone with no tab open, and the reason the client
  already uses a service worker
  (`2026-08-17-deadlight-notifications-design.md`).
  **Evidence: see the notice-store finding above.** The most expensive item in
  this file, resting on a feature with no recorded use.
- A relay sink (ntfy/Pushover) for notifications: a configured webhook POSTed
  on publish, a cheaper route to a phone than Web Push at the cost of a third
  party and a token to store (`2026-08-17-deadlight-notifications-design.md`).
  **Evidence: see the notice-store finding above.**

## Editing

### What "how rich" means here

The terminal is where an AI agent does the editing. The browser editor is
therefore not an authoring surface competing with it; it is where a human
*reads* what the agent wrote and makes a small correction — a typo, a config
value, a line to delete. That distinction, not a feature list, is the limit on
"how rich":

- **In scope:** anything that helps you read a file accurately and make one
  small change correctly.
- **Out of scope:** anything that helps you author at volume or navigate a
  codebase. That is the agent's job, and the terminal editor already does it
  better. LSP, diagnostics, autocomplete, multi-cursor, refactoring,
  project-wide search/replace, git gutters, and vim/emacs keymaps all stay
  out — now for a stated reason rather than by blanket exclusion.

### Low-hanging fruit, in order

Edit mode is a real `<textarea>` wrapped in `code-input`, which paints a
highlighted `<pre>` beneath it (`static/app.js`, `mountEditor`). What is
missing is everything around the text itself.

**Evidence (2026-08-20): this is the one section with measured demand behind
it.** Across the five saved workspaces on this host there are 29 tabs, of which
**9 are File tabs** and 2 carry persisted buffers — so the viewer and editor are
genuinely in use, unlike most of the UI/UX list above. That does not rank the
four items below against each other, but it does mean the section is not
speculative.

1. Tab inserts an indent instead of moving focus; auto-indent on Enter.
2. Line numbers, and go-to-line. **Half done (2026-08-30).** Project search
   landed the addressing half: `Event::RevealLine` scrolls both the editor and
   a code preview to a given line, wrap-aware, and terminal links now land on
   the line they name. What is still missing is the *visible* half — numbers in
   a gutter, and a way to ask for a line rather than being sent to one.
3. In-buffer find. Browser find over a `textarea` barely works. Project search
   does not cover this: `⇧⌃F` searches files on disk, not the buffer you are
   editing, and it cannot see unsaved changes at all.
4. Bracket and quote auto-close.

Items 1 and 4 are cheaper than they look: `code-input`, already vendored,
ships optional single-file plugins for indentation and bracket closing.

**Whatever implements them must not change the bytes.** Save is conflict-
guarded against a hash of what was read from disk, and `texts` must match the
buffer exactly or `EditBuffer`, the stale flag and live-follow of external
edits all misbehave — a corrupted file or a save that conflicts with itself,
which no Rust test can see. Anything that normalises whitespace or newlines is
disqualified, and any change here is tested through the real save path
(`tests/browser/hledit.mjs`).

## Search

Shipped 2026-08-30 (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-29-project-search-design.md`).
Everything here was deferred *during* that work with a reason, or found by
using it afterwards — so unlike most of this file, these entries have measured
demand behind them.

- **`.gitignore` awareness.** The spec ruled it out for v1 on the grounds that
  `SKIP_DIRS` covers the common cases, and that held until it didn't: a
  1.1 GB Chromium profile at `tests/browser/tmp/profile` — gitignored, so
  `git status` never complained — exhausted the entire 20 000-file budget and
  a search of this repo came back truncated. That instance was fixed by moving
  the profile out of the checkout, but the general shape recurs for any
  gitignored build output not named `target`. The walk reads the filesystem;
  git reads the index; nothing reconciles them.
- ~~**A stronger selected-row highlight.**~~ **Done (2026-08-30.)** Kept here
  because the fix this entry prescribed was wrong, and the reason is worth not
  rediscovering. `.searchrow.sel` was `--tool` — mixed against `--bg`, so
  *darker* than the panel's own `--bg2`, 1.12:1 in the dark theme. But
  `--tab-on` is `--tool` plus 10% `--fg`, so on a `--bg2` panel it lands at
  1.02:1: the prescribed repair measured worse than the bug in four of five
  themes. A highlight has to be mixed against **the surface it is drawn on**,
  which is what the new `--row-on` does. Verified in Chromium across every
  theme in `static/themes/`, by rasterising the colour through a canvas —
  `getComputedStyle` returns an unresolved `oklab(...)` for a `color-mix` and
  cannot be luminance-parsed. `tests/browser/search.mjs` now asserts it, and
  fails on both wrong versions.
- **⇧⇧ is unreliable and unadvertised.** On the deploy host's browser a lone
  Shift keydown never reaches the page at all — a capture-phase listener on
  `document` printed nothing, while `Ctrl+Shift+F` worked in the same tab.
  Something between the keyboard and the browser eats standalone modifier
  presses there. The binding is left in place (it works wherever it can be
  tested and cannot false-fire) but the header advertises the chord. Do not
  reopen this without first checking that a bare Shift produces a keydown.
- **Two `handle` calls on the tab-reuse path.** `do_open_at_line` issues
  `OpenTab` and then `SetMode` when the file is already open, so that path
  bumps the version twice, broadcasts `State` twice, persists twice, and
  re-reads the file for a `BufferText` that was just confirmed settled. Correct
  but wasteful, on the feature's primary path. The best cleanup candidate here.
- **Symbols.** The header hint used to promise "files, symbols, sessions" and
  now promises "files, contents, sessions", because symbols need parsing or
  ctags and neither was in scope. If they ever land, that string is where the
  promise goes back.
- **Cross-project search.** Declined for v1: it multiplies both walk cost and
  the ranking question, and `/` already answers "where is that other project".
- **`Query::contents == false` has no test**, and neither do the
  `MAX_FILES_SCANNED` and `DEADLINE` caps — the latter two because provoking
  them costs 20 000 files or a 1.5 s stall.
- **The header advertises two shortcuts that do not exist.** `render.rs`'s bell
  and refresh buttons say "notifications (n)" and "refresh (r)"; `grep` finds
  no handler for either. Predates search; found while auditing which chords
  were free.

## Terminals and sessions

- `retach` as the session backend instead of `dtach`, if its scrollback replay
  proves worth the immaturity — deferred with a stated reason (dtach is stable,
  retach is not) in the v3 spec's nice-to-haves
  (`2026-08-16-deadlight-v3-workspace-design.md`).
  **Evidence (2026-08-20): not measurable from this host.** Whether retach has
  matured is a question about retach's upstream, not about anything here. What
  *is* visible locally: dtach is carrying 16 live sessions across restarts
  without complaint, so the incumbent is not under pressure.
- Per-session CPU and memory sampling, shown next to session age — deferred
  with a stated reason in the projects spec's "Future work": needs a sampling
  cadence and per-platform code (`/proc` on Linux, `ps` on macOS), and nothing
  else in that design depends on it (`2026-08-17-deadlight-projects-design.md`).
  **Evidence (2026-08-20): demand unmeasured, but note the adjacent finding.**
  The zellij leftovers below went unnoticed for weeks while holding ~342 MB —
  exactly the kind of thing per-process visibility surfaces. That is an argument
  for the feature, though not one the original entry made.

- **Flags for the one-click Claude terminal.** The ✻ button spawns `claude`
  with no arguments; a global-only config key would let it be `claude
  --continue` or similar. Global-only for the usual reason — a per-project
  value would let a cloned checkout decide what a click on your machine
  executes. Deferred 2026-08-23.
  **Demand unmeasured.** Nobody has asked.

- Persisting a session's mode table across a roost restart — the one case
  `2026-08-20-sticky-modes-design.md` deliberately does not fix. Modes are
  tracked in memory (`screen::Screens`), so a restart leaves an already-running
  full-screen app holding a contract the new process never saw, and the app
  never repeats itself: a `SIGWINCH` repaint re-declares nothing (measured —
  `?1049h` after a winch: 0). The spec rejects persistence for the *screen*
  bit, and that rejection stands: a stale "on the alternate screen" marker
  leaves a blank buffer with the shell's output going somewhere invisible.
  Modes are the cheap half — a wrongly-asserted mouse mode shows up as visible
  junk on the command line and clears on the next Ctrl-C — which is the whole
  argument for treating them differently.
  **Evidence (2026-08-20): this fires on every deploy, and today there were
  nine.** `journalctl --user -u resh` records 9 restarts today, and **4 of the
  7** live sessions on this host are running Claude Code right now — so each
  restart desynchronised four terminals. Measured after one: a reattached
  browser reads `bracketedPaste: false, mouse: "none", focus: false`, and a
  paste goes on the wire as `"one\rtwo"` rather than
  `"\e[200~one\rtwo\e[201~"`, so a pasted three-line prompt submits its first
  line on its own. **A page reload does not fix it** — a reload is the same
  attach, replaying a table that is empty. Restarting the app does, and Claude
  re-asserts its *mouse* modes on interaction so that half tends to heal by
  itself; `?2004h` it emits once at startup only, so paste does not.

### Peer sessions (`resh peers`, 2026-08-23)

- **Nothing guarantees the group is told.** The hook informs the session that
  is starting and no one else; that session is instructed to announce itself to
  each peer, which is a convention carried out by a model, not a guarantee. A
  session that ignores it, or whose peer refuses inbound messages, leaves the
  group as uninformed as before. A guarantee means roost pushing into running
  sessions or re-checking on a timer — a lifecycle, where today there is one
  file read.
  **Evidence (2026-08-23): the one-way gap was measured before the change.**
  `resh-2e` (started 09:52) was told about `resh-f8` at its own start and
  quoted it back verbatim over `SendMessage`; `resh-f8` (started 05:44) was
  never told about `resh-2e` and found it hours later by running `resh peers`
  by hand. Whether the announcement instruction is actually followed in
  practice has **not** been measured — it was deployed the same day.

- **Names can collide, and roost cannot print an unambiguous one.** A collision
  is detected and warned about, but not prevented: roost can neither mint nor
  read the short ref `ListAgents` uses to disambiguate, and `SendMessage`
  accepts no pid. A reader who ignores the warning still messages the wrong
  session.
  **Evidence (2026-08-23): the collision was observed once, that morning, and
  had ended by the afternoon.** Whether the detection ever fires again has not
  been measured — it was deployed the same day, on a host where all nine live
  sessions then had distinct names.

- **roost's own UI says nothing about peers.** The count is known per project at
  any moment, so the picker or project strip could badge a project more than
  one Claude is working in — reaching the person rather than only the arriving
  session, and sidestepping the asymmetry above entirely.
  **Demand unmeasured.** Raised while designing the hook and never asked for.

- **The `git` call has no timeout of its own.** `git_common_dir` uses
  `Command::output()`, which blocks until git exits. A git that hangs — a
  repository on a network filesystem, or one waiting on a lock another process
  holds — would stall a session start rather than let it proceed.
  **Evidence (2026-08-23): measured, and small.** Three resolutions took 10ms
  on this host, ~3ms each, and the hook entry carries `timeout: 10`, so even a
  fully wedged git costs ten seconds once and the session then starts anyway.
  The resolution is also lazy, so a session alone in a project spends none at
  all. That backstop is Claude Code's, not roost's: a caller wiring `resh peers`
  without a timeout inherits the stall.

- **A sibling whose liveness cannot be judged is dropped silently.** The
  `uncheckable` count deliberately covers same-directory records only, so an
  unreadable `/proc` entry for a session in another worktree produces no line
  at all rather than an "N could not be checked" note. That asymmetry is a
  decision, not an oversight: a missed peer means overwritten work while a
  missed sibling means a missed advisory, and reporting uncertainty about the
  quiet case costs more noise than it buys. Recorded so the next reader finds a
  decision rather than rediscovers a gap.
  **Not measured.** No unreadable `/proc` entry has been observed on this host;
  the path exists because it must, not because it has fired.

- **`roots` lives in two places and must be kept in step by hand.**
  `Environment=ROOST_ROOTS` in the unit file and `roots` in
  `~/.config/roost/config.toml`. Drift is detected and reported, not prevented;
  the env var winning is deliberate, so the fix is not deleting one but
  teaching the unit to read the config.
  **Not measured.** Both entries were written on 2026-08-23 and have not
  drifted; the detector has never fired.

**Retired 2026-08-25.** Replaced by steering a second Claude into its own
worktree — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-25-worktree-launch-design.md`,
whose opening section records the repro that ended it: resuming a session
still open in another process, and the hook warning a session about itself.

## Git

- Enforcing project == git repo more strongly than the current soft gate
  ("start without git" escape hatch) — speculative, conditional on the soft
  gate proving too soft in practice; projects spec's "Future work"
  (`2026-08-17-deadlight-projects-design.md`).
  **Evidence (2026-08-20): argues against doing this.** **6 of 23** project
  directories under the configured roots are not git repositories —
  `karpie-validation`, `aeneas-btree`, `bench-parity`, `leanstral-demo`,
  `rings-bench`, `uc-bench-data`. Enforcing project == git repo would lock out
  a quarter of what is actually on this host. The soft gate is not proving too
  soft; it is carrying real load.

## Platform / deployment

- Retiring the legacy zellij-web (8082) and code-server (8443) endpoints —
  deferred deliberately in the v2 spec until deadlight "has earned trust"
  (`2026-08-16-deadlight-v2-design.md`); `docs/deploy.md` still lists
  code-server as a kept fallback, so this remains open.
  **Evidence (2026-08-20): half done, and the other half is live — this is the
  one entry the measurement made MORE urgent, not less.** code-server is
  genuinely gone (binary absent, no unit). Zellij is not: **five processes,
  ~342 MB RSS, ~22 h uptime** — a `zellij web --start --daemonize` listening on
  `127.0.0.1:8082` plus four `--server` instances — and `tailscale serve` still
  maps `:8443` to it. Zellij was replaced by dtach back in v3, so all of that is
  leftovers holding a third of a gigabyte and a tailnet route into a shell
  spawner nothing uses.

  `kill-all-sessions` will not clear them: zellij sessions have reported
  themselves EXITED while the processes lived on, so they go by pid, with the
  `:8443` route dropped separately. Host-specific commands are in
  `~/.config/roost/deploy-host.md`.

## Code structure

- Move `IMAGE_EXT` / `is_image` / `NO_TEXT_EDIT_EXT` / `refuses_text_edit` out
  of `routes.rs` and into `assets.rs`, where `ext_of` and `THEME_EXT` already
  live. `workspace.rs` is pure state logic and now reaches into the HTTP layer
  for three predicates, which is backwards
  (`2026-08-19-preview-links-and-images-design.md`).
- `IMAGE_EXT` and `NO_TEXT_EDIT_EXT` are each hand-mirrored in
  `static/app.js` with nothing checking the copies agree. Divergence costs a
  wrongly shown or hidden ✎ toggle, never data — `workspace.rs` is the real
  guard — but it is the same unchecked-sync hazard `FRAGMENT_KINDS` carries,
  and a build-time check could close both.

### Sharp edges around buffers and workspace state

Deferred review findings, each confirmed still present on 2026-08-22.

- **`wsstate::load` reads an unreadable state file as "never saved".**
  `let Ok(text) = std::fs::read_to_string(path_for(project)) else { return (w,
  None) }` — a permissions blip, or any transient error, is indistinguishable
  from a first run, silently. The workspace comes up as the default layout,
  and the *next* save writes that default over the real state file: every tab,
  and any unsaved buffer text it held, gone. This is the eleven-times defect in
  CLAUDE.md's own table, in the one place whose whole job is not losing state.
  `symlink_metadata` distinguishes the three cases; `Err(NotFound)` is the only
  one that means "never saved".
- **A restore with more than `MAX_BUFFERS` dirty buffers is unbounded.** The
  load cap deliberately truncates only the clean tail, so unsaved work is never
  dropped to make room — right, but it means a hand-edited or corrupt file can
  make `reconcile_buffers_with_disk` re-read arbitrarily many files under the
  registry lock. A sanity ceiling with a warning would close it without
  reintroducing the data loss.
- **`stale` can be true on a `Clean` buffer** (edit → external change → undo
  back to base), which the design doc says cannot happen. Self-heals on
  reactivation; cosmetic, but the doc is wrong until one of them moves.
- **A rename during `wsconn`'s unlocked replay window** rekeys the buffer with
  no `BufferText`, so the old rel replays nothing and the new one is absent
  from the snapshot. Pre-dates the branch.
- **Preview-only buffers get a full `BufferText`**, not the hash-only update
  the spec describes, so every client holds the text of every previewed file in
  `texts`.
- **Two no-op assignments** (`hub.rs`, `b.content = Content::Clean` inside an
  `if b.dirty()` else-branch, where it is already `Clean`).

## Testing

- `tests/browser/mdlinks.mjs`'s `javascript:` step evaluates `!!a` to prove the
  danger anchor was found, then discards the result — so if that anchor ever
  vanished from the preview, the two assertions after it would pass vacuously.
  The `no javascript: href reached the page` assertion beside them is
  independently discriminating, so the security property stays covered, but
  this is the same defect class that produced three vacuous tests during that
  branch's own execution and it is a one-line fix
  (`2026-08-19-preview-links-and-images-design.md`).
- Three tests carry assertions weaker than their comments claim, all from the
  buffers-without-text branch and all verified still present on 2026-08-22:
  `routes.rs`'s `clicking_an_image_shows_a_picture_not_a_binary_error` matches
  the image URL by prefix rather than anchored, so a stray parameter appended
  after `v=<n>` would pass (the mtime is wall-clock, which is why it was
  loosened); `preview-follows.mjs` uses one pane and one file, so the
  "does not re-fetch other panes" property is only verified by reading the
  `rel` match; and `wsstate`'s pre-`base_hash` fixture hand-builds
  `state_dir().join(...)` instead of using the in-scope `path_for`, so a change
  to the naming scheme would make it miss the file.
- `tests/integration.rs`'s `notices_are_replayed_on_connect_and_read_state_mirrors`
  fails intermittently, timing out waiting for `"read":true`. Diagnosed
  mechanism: `notify::load()` ends by *destructively* replacing the
  process-global in-memory notice store with whatever it just read off disk
  (`s.notices = list.into()`), and `lib.rs` calls `notify::load()` on every
  `serve()`. `tests/integration.rs`'s `start()` spawns `serve()` on a thread
  and returns immediately, and this one binary stands up 31 servers — 7 direct
  `start(...)` calls plus 24 through `fixture()`, which calls it too (counted
  at `76b22c8`). `WS_TEST_LOCK` serialises the websocket tests against each
  other, but not against the 28 of 54 tests that do not take it, which freely
  `start()` servers of their own and set/remove `ROOST_STATE_DIR` as they go.
  So one test's `load()` can read a *different* test's state dir — including,
  if the timing lines up wrong, the developer's real `~/.local/state/roost/` — and
  evict the notice another test just published out from under it. When that
  happens, `MarkNoticeRead` finds no such id, and `hub.rs` rebroadcasts
  unconditionally with a notice list in which nothing ended up marked read,
  so the client waiting on `"read":true` times out. Suggested fix: make
  `load()` non-destructive (merge incoming notices by id rather than
  replacing the store wholesale), or gate it behind a `OnceLock` so it only
  ever runs once per process; either way, the integration binary also wants
  one shared env lock covering every `start()` call, not just the websocket
  ones. This predates embedded assets, which has since merged to master and
  brought two more `start()` call sites into the same binary — so the race is
  marginally more likely to trigger now, not less.
