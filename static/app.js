// is held — mozilla bug 300678 / 44259, open for two decades. There is no
// physical-key information in that event at all: the composed character is
// the only thing identifying it, which is why it is matched literally here.

// therefore layout-specific by necessity, not by choice — on a layout where
// Option+K composes something else, Firefox on macOS has nothing left to
// match on. The durable answer for that case is a Cmd chord (Cmd does not

// Double-tap Shift, IntelliJ-style. Two properties make it safe to arm on the
// document even while a terminal has focus, which is where focus usually is:
//
//   - Shift alone emits nothing to a shell, so intercepting it steals no
//     keystroke. Any Ctrl-/Cmd- chord would have to be taken away from the
//     program running in the terminal instead.
//   - The two presses must be consecutive. Typing "HI" presses Shift twice in
//     quick succession, but the H lands between them and resets the pending
//     state, so ordinary typing cannot open this.
//
// 400 ms was the first guess and it was too tight to use: measured against a
// real browser through CDP's input pipeline, a 350 ms gap opened the overlay
// and a 450 ms gap did not. 700 ms is roughly a Windows double-click default
// with room to spare, and it costs no safety: the intervening-key reset above
// is what stops ordinary typing from reaching here, not the length of the
// window.
//
// **This shortcut cannot be relied on, and ⌘⇧F / Ctrl+Shift+F is the one the
// header advertises.** On the deploy host's own browser a lone Shift keydown
// never reaches the page at all: a capture-phase listener on `document` —
// which sees every event the page receives, before anything could stop it —
// printed nothing for Shift, while Ctrl+Shift+F worked in the same tab, so
// Shift *as a modifier* arrives normally. Something between the keyboard and
// the browser (a remapper, an extension, an input setting) swallows standalone
// modifier presses there.
//
// Widening this window was a wasted fix aimed at that report; the window was
// genuinely too small, but it was never the cause. Left bound because it works
// wherever it can be tested and cannot false-fire, but do not spend time on it
// again without first checking that a bare Shift produces a keydown at all.

// replacement, and ⇧⇧ above is left exactly as it is.
//
// Shift is what makes the chord affordable. A terminal encodes Ctrl-F and
// Ctrl-Shift-F identically — both are `^F` — so binding the shifted one takes
// *nothing* from the shell: plain Ctrl-F still reaches readline as
// forward-char, and xterm needs no special case. That is the whole reason to
// prefer it over the plain chord, which would have had to be refused in
// `attachCustomKeyEventHandler` and would have cost `^F` at every prompt.
//
// `metaKey` on a Mac and `ctrlKey` elsewhere, the same platform split
// `linkModifier` uses — and deliberately not Alt, which readline binds heavily
// and which *composes* on macOS (see the mention handler above, reduced to
// matching the literal `˚` that Option+K produces).
//
// preventDefault takes the browser's own find bar, which is the point: it
// would only ever search the pane that happens to be rendered.
// Ctrl OR Meta, not `IS_MAC ? meta : ctrl`. The platform split is right for
// `linkModifier`, where ⌘-click and Ctrl-click are genuinely different
// gestures — but for a chord there is no conflict to resolve, and the split
// adds a way to fail silently: `IS_MAC` reads `navigator.platform`, which is
// deprecated and returns "" or a frozen value in some browsers, and a
// misdetection makes the handler demand a modifier the user is not pressing.
// Nothing is gained by being strict here.
