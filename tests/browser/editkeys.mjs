//! Editing keys in a code file: Tab indents, Enter keeps the indent, brackets
//! and quotes close themselves.
//!
//! These are two vendored `code-input` plugins, and nothing in Rust can see
//! any of it. What makes them worth a test beyond "does Tab work" is the
//! constraint the feature sits under: **save is conflict-guarded against a
//! hash of what was read from disk**, so a plugin that rewrote the buffer —
//! a whitespace normaliser, a line-ending fixer, an indentation converter —
//! would make a file conflict with itself or silently reformat on open.
//! Section E is that assertion, and it is the reason this file exists.
//!
//! Traps this file is written against (see README):
//!
//!   - **Every keystroke goes through `Input.dispatchKeyEvent`**, not a
//!     synthesised `KeyboardEvent`. The plugins listen on `keydown` and call
//!     `preventDefault`; a synthetic event cannot suppress the browser's own
//!     Tab handling, so a test built from one would assert about a focus move
//!     that never happened in a real browser, or miss one that did.
//!   - **Every assertion that a byte reached disk reads the file**, not the
//!     textarea. The textarea is where the plugin wrote; the whole question
//!     is whether that survives the debounce, `EditBuffer` and the save.
//!   - **Section E types nothing at all before its first check.** A
//!     byte-fidelity test that edits first cannot tell "the save path is
//!     faithful" from "the edit happened to cancel out the damage".
//!   - **Section D asserts the prose file's Tab moves focus**, which is the
//!     control for section B: without it, "Tab inserted an indent" is equally
//!     satisfied by a build where the plugin is applied to everything.
//!
//! Run: deno run -A tests/browser/editkeys.mjs
