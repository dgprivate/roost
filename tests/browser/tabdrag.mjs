//! Dragging a tab: between panes, and within one to reorder.
//!
//! Every line of this lives in static/app.js, where `cargo test` cannot
//! reach. The server needs no change at all — `Intent::MoveTab { from, idx,
//! to, at }` already carries a destination *index*, and the ⇄ button simply
//! always passes the destination's length — so the whole feature is the
//! client deciding `at` from where the pointer is. Nothing in Rust can verify
//! that decision.
//!
//! Traps this file is written against (see README):
//!
//!   - **`draggable` is asserted separately from the handlers.** The drops
//!     below are dispatched as real `DragEvent`s carrying a real
//!     `DataTransfer`, which exercises the handlers faithfully but would pass
//!     just as well against tabs the browser would never let you pick up.
//!     Section A asserts the attribute; the rest assert the behaviour.
//!   - **Every assertion is on *which* tab moved, never on a count.** A count
//!     is equally satisfied by moving the wrong tab, which is the whole
//!     failure mode of an off-by-one in `at`.
//!   - **The same-pane cases use three tabs, not two.** With two, "insert
//!     before" and "insert after" produce the same array whichever way the
//!     index adjustment goes, so a reorder test on two tabs cannot fail.
//!   - **Section D drives both drags over the same target, in both orders.**
//!     roost already uses drag-and-drop for file upload, and a tab handler
//!     that did not check the type would swallow a file drop — uploads would
//!     stop working with no error anywhere. Asserting only that a tab drag
//!     works would never see it.
//!
//! Revert-checked, each change applied and watched to fail: dropping the
//! same-pane index adjustment, ignoring the pointer position and always
//! appending, un-setting `draggable`, removing the drop indicator, and a tab
//! drop handler that claims every drop before checking the type.
//!
//! One reversion deliberately does *not* fail, and it is worth knowing why
//! rather than papering over: deleting the type check from the tab `dragover`
//! handler alone changes no behaviour, because `dragTabSource` is null during
//! a file drag and the handler returns before it prevents anything. That is
//! defence in depth rather than a gap in this file — the check that does
//! carry the weight is the one in `drop`, and R6 above pins it.
